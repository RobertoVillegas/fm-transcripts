[00:00:00]
>> So let's go and make details actually look like a nice page, right? Cuz right now it's just kinda outputting data. So we're gonna make this an actual method. Does anyone have any questions? It's good question to ask him, a good time to ask. Okay, yeah, go ahead.

[00:00:30]

>> How does types .JSX get imported again?
>> It's automatically imported because it's in the flow type directory.
>> So when you add the comment on the top it imports all of that?
>> Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, it's kinda magical. There are ways to do it that you don't have to go through flow typed, but that's just a established cow path so I tend to follow that.

[00:00:59]
Okay, so const { title, description, Year, poster, trailer} = props.shows. If you've never seen this before, this is called destructuring which came with ES6 ES 2015 as well. It's basically saying inside of props that show I know I have a variable called title, pull it out and call it title.

[00:01:39]
If you wanted to write a long way, this would be const title = props.show.title, const description equals, etc, etc, etc, right? This is just shorthand for that. Now it's gonna be yelling at me was like, hey, I don't have prop type validations for this, b But pretty easy for us to do.

[00:02:01]
We can say props and you're gonna be getting a show which is a Show. Okay, now they look like they're still errors. That's because we haven't used them yet, which ESLint doesn't like. Sometimes it's kind of hard to figure out who's yelling at you now. [LAUGH]
But I promise it is all worth it.

[00:02:33]
Okay, so what we're gonna do here is we're gonna delete all of this cuz we don't need it anymore. And we're gonna make a header, which is gonna be an h1 with svideo so we have a nice header again. Then underneath that we're gonna put a section with a h1 with {title}, h2 with {year} and again, if you remember we wanted this literally surrounded with parentheses around the year.

[00:03:11]
So we're just gonna put parentheses around that. We're gonna have an <img src={'/public/img/posters/${poster}'} and then we're gonna give it an alt because we're good citizens of the internet. And then we're gonna say, { Poster for ${title}. Not only just putting in all tags like that's already important for accessibility in fact, there's a grade for the Master's Course, by John on accessibility that you all should definitely watch, because we are all deficient at accessibility.

[00:04:08]
But also Airbnb, the ESLint rules will enforce on you to write those alt texts. So you have to, [LAUGH] Okay, and then here we're gonna do a description as well. Okay, underneath this section we're gonna do a div. And then here, we're gonna do something kinda fun. We're gonna put an iframe, cuz who doesn't love iframes, But we're actually gonna embed the YouTube trailer for each individual pay show.

[00:04:57]
So the first thing and you're just gonna have to bear with me because the URL is super long. https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/$/{trailer} and then ?rel=0&amp; controls=0&amp;showinfo=0 that's it. FrameBorder="0", allowFullScreen and then think this is a new one, I think iframes in fact it says here, requires a title, again, which is for accessibility purposes.

[00:06:07]
You have to say title=, {Trailer}, For ${title}. This is so a screen reader, if they tap into it, it's gonna identify the iframe by what the content is inside of it. And it's gonna do that by the title. If you haven't looked at your site with the screen reader should definitely do that.

[00:06:42]
Okay, so now hopefully come back to our page and we're gonna go to details and then just one of the valid IMDb IDs, you should be able to go in there and you should be able to see like a nice looking details page. Right, it's got the title.

[00:07:03]
It's got the year. It's got the poster up there, the little description. So it looks something more like that. And then you can actually click it and play the video and all that kind of stuff. So,
