00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.150
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: So, the practice exercises
are pretty much the same as before.

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.210
Let's do the first one together,
make sure that it works,

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.000
cuz we are in plugins now and not themes.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.580
It's gonna be a little bit different, and

5
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.840
then you can do the other two on your own,
okay?

6
00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.440
What we need to do first is get the files,

7
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.278
so come back over to the repo,
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: And

8
00:00:21.278 --> 00:00:27.140
go into section two, enqueue a plugin and
copy all these files.

9
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.652
And then, instead of putting
them in your theme's folder,

10
00:00:32.652 --> 00:00:34.788
paste them into your plugins folder.

11
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.602
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: Okay, so
now you should have all of those there and

12
00:00:46.602 --> 00:00:50.594
we're going to close out
the themes that we're editing, and

13
00:00:50.594 --> 00:00:54.543
let's drag our whole plugins
folder into our theme editor.

14
00:01:00.835 --> 00:01:03.182
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: So,
we've got that code ready, and

15
00:01:03.182 --> 00:01:06.780
now I need to mention something
about it on the backend.

16
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.150
So, there's a page for plugins.

17
00:01:16.337 --> 00:01:18.221
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: When
you're working on these,

18
00:01:18.221 --> 00:01:21.090
please don't leave them
all activated at once.

19
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.190
You may start to get some compatibility
issues because some of the code is shared,

20
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.260
and some of the stuff is the same.

21
00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:31.050
I tried to make it so that it would
potentially work, but what I'd like you to

22
00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.380
do is when you're working on, for example,
in queueing the frontend JavaScript.

23
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.820
Let's all activate 2.1 together right now.

24
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.210
And then, when we're done with it,
deactivate it like that, and

25
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.757
then go onto 2.2, okay?

26
00:01:45.757 --> 00:01:50.364
So, everybody go ahead and
activate 2.1 right now.

27
00:01:52.838 --> 00:01:56.783
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: And then, in our 2.1 JS
folder, we're going to come down into

28
00:01:56.783 --> 00:02:00.258
the read me and
just look at the instructions real quick.

29
00:02:00.258 --> 00:02:06.330
Okay, so we're going to open up a file
called somethingPHP frontend.js-js,

30
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.380
and then we're looking for nq scripts.

31
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.130
Okay, we know what that is, and
then we want to just change the file name,

32
00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.630
and then pass in file.

33
00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:17.530
That's it.

34
00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.137
Okay, let's check that up.

35
00:02:19.137 --> 00:02:22.357
So, if I come in to my
jsforwpfrontend.php,

36
00:02:22.357 --> 00:02:25.336
this is the information about the plugin.

37
00:02:25.336 --> 00:02:29.630
And then remember, like I said,
sometimes WordPress will have

38
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.577
conditional code at the beginning that
will exit out of all the rest of it.

39
00:02:34.577 --> 00:02:38.924
So, if somebody is trying to access this
plugin directly, it will tell on, hey,

40
00:02:38.924 --> 00:02:41.130
you don't have access and take them out.

41
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.250
Okay, so change path to file.js to

42
00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.980
use plug ins URL and
then pass it to parameters.

43
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.040
This is going to be my first, and
this is going to be my second.

44
00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.075
Okay, so I'm going to delete this
code here This code right here,

45
00:03:02.075 --> 00:03:05.355
delete that and say,

46
00:03:05.355 --> 00:03:10.220
plugins_url and it's gonna take two
parameters and we'll do this easy way.

47
00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.011
We'll just copy this code,
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: Paste it in and then

48
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:19.720
copy FILE and it's a second parameter,
so they need to be comma separated.

49
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.750
So you need a comma right here And
then file.

50
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.130
Okay, I'm not trying to make your lives
difficult, but this is the convention.

51
00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.840
Again, this is something that
needs to become second nature.

52
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.670
You need to be able to like remember okay
I've got plug ins url, I put this in here,

53
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:35.940
I put that in there.

54
00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.040
And, from there, I'm going.

55
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.150
And, for now, if we, we should be
able to just come to our site.

56
00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.190
The plug in is activated.

57
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.840
Notice, I still have my
JavaScript from before.

58
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.150
But now I've got plug in JS loaded.

59
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.250
Sweet.
That's perfect.

60
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.650
And it's coming from my main JS file,
which is inside of my assets.

61
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.890
JS main right here.

62
00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:00.280
Plug in JS loaded, okay
