00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.510
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: Okay, so the next thing
I wanna do is make sure that you copy

2
00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.990
the simple post's endpoint plugin.

3
00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.000
Make sure you put that
in the plugins folder.

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.214
And then come into your plugins area.

5
00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:21.150
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: We'll make sure
all our old stuff is deactivated.

6
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.100
And then make sure to activate
this simple posts endpoint.

7
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:33.983
And what this does is,
then on your site at .com/simple/v1/posts,

8
00:00:33.983 --> 00:00:40.660
you could see some even more
trimmed down data about posts.

9
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.917
So let's go ahead and
copy this from WP JSON,

10
00:00:43.917 --> 00:00:47.277
all the way in the posts and
put this in our URL.

11
00:00:52.708 --> 00:00:56.045
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: So notice now,
I'm getting all my posts still but

12
00:00:56.045 --> 00:00:58.610
look at the simplicity of this.

13
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.490
Remember before, we had title.rendered and
we had the GUD and

14
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.620
we had all the date modifications and
all these other stuff.

15
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.480
Now what we have is the simple ID,
URLs, slug, title, excerpt, content.

16
00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.490
Boom, done, right?

17
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.740
So obviously this is going to be
faster for the query to build and

18
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.930
to get out to your site and
that's gonna be faster to process.

19
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.900
So this again, my recommendation for
trying to slim stuff down a little bit and

20
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.900
let's just take a quick moment and
look at the code here behind it.

21
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.672
So go ahead and open up that folder,
jsforwpsimplepostsendpoint,

22
00:01:35.672 --> 00:01:38.233
and then open that main plugin file.

23
00:01:41.907 --> 00:01:43.223
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: Again, this is PHP, and

24
00:01:43.223 --> 00:01:47.560
my expectation's not necessarily that
you'll walk away knowing how to do this.

25
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.650
There is pretty good documentation on
the site that I showed you before.

26
00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.150
But the different pieces
should make sense.

27
00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.170
So first of all, I'm registering my route
and I'm telling them what it's gonna be,

28
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.300
so it's gonna be /simple/V1 and
then I'm only gonna have posts available.

29
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.820
You could only get posts, so
I'm not gonna let anybody save or

30
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.660
delete posts with my code, and then if
somebody hits this, what should they do.

31
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.260
Well, that's gonna load this call
back function which will tell it,

32
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.450
tell WordPress what to do.

33
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.073
So, coming down

34
00:02:23.073 --> 00:02:27.802
into that,
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: First we set

35
00:02:27.802 --> 00:02:30.020
up some arguments for
this get posts function.

36
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.610
So again, this is kind of PHP stuff but

37
00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.640
this is one of the simple ways in
WordPress to get a bunch of post.

38
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.030
So here I'm saying -1 means
get me all of the posts.

39
00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.060
So I had set this to 3, it would have
limited it and there's a bunch of

40
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.080
arguments you could search for
get_posts if you wanna do more on this.

41
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.070
It's documented pretty well.

42
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.900
If there aren't any
posts don't do anything.

43
00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.210
But then if there are posts, so
if I get posts back, then for each post,

44
00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:05.290
go ahead and create a new simple_post
that only has this specific data, right?

45
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.190
So I'm getting my post here,
this is a foreach loop.

46
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.950
And then I'm saying set ID, equal to
ID set URLs equal to the unique ID.

47
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.580
Set the slug, set the title,
set the excerpt.

48
00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:23.140
This is going to apply any HTML to it so
that you get access

49
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.140
to that HTML otherwise it might come
out unformatted which you don't want.

50
00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.210
And then push those all to this
one array and feedback that array.

51
00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.900
So this is enough if you
needed a custom media one,

52
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.440
if you needed a custom comment or
anything that you wanted to trim down.

53
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.680
You should be able to tweak this and
get to where you need to go.

54
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.210
But if we come into the browser now and go
to simple v1, we see exactly that, right?

55
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.610
If I were to comment out some of these,
and

56
00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.040
maybe I only wanted titles back,
then it would trim it down even more.

57
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.810
But notice that once we make
this request and get our posts,

58
00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.540
it doesn't really matter what data we add.

59
00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.210
It's not really gonna
slow it down too much.

60
00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:07.940
It's how many more other requests we
need to then go make on top of that.

61
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.860
So if I wanted to pull in the author name,
that's a whole another request on top.

62
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.840
So again, just stuff to think about and

63
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.980
really that is all we need
to know about practicing and

64
00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.030
getting comfortable with
the WordPress Rest API.

65
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.850
So I'll pause here at this point just
to see if there are any questions about

66
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.050
anything that weâ€™ve covered up to
this point in terms of endpoints,

67
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.910
arguments, or custom endpoints.
