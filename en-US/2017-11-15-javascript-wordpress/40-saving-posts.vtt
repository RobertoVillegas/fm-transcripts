1
00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.510
&gt;&gt; Zac: So now we have authentication
basically up and running.

2
00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:10.232
I'm going to run through the saving
with you together, so that we've really

3
00:00:10.232 --> 00:00:15.610
hit a solid point of covering everything
that really wanted to cover today.

4
00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.170
And then you can go into editing and
deleting on your own if you want to, and

5
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.220
explore that, okay?

6
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.020
So we're gonna power through a little bit
more and work on this savings set up.

7
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.140
We will exit out of this
demo that we just did and

8
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.270
move into 6.4, so let me just get
over there in my command line.

9
00:00:40.141 --> 00:00:42.092
&gt;&gt; Zac: I'm gonna run npm install.

10
00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:48.921
&gt;&gt; Zac: And the one thing we
wanna check for in this case,

11
00:00:48.921 --> 00:00:53.510
is that we have this TinyMCE
folder inside of our distribution.

12
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.580
If we look inside of our index.html,

13
00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.810
because we're going to be
working with the TinyMCE editor.

14
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.330
We have a hard coded link to it.

15
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:06.290
So you could use ES6 or modules and
imports and run them that way.

16
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.080
I found it was easiest to just
leave it separate then pull it in.

17
00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.319
And like I said, you could easily
swap this out for other editors,

18
00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:19.852
TinyMCE is not by means the only one
out there or the latest weight one.

19
00:01:19.852 --> 00:01:24.486
So you can do some exploration, but
because it does have some complexities.

20
00:01:24.486 --> 00:01:28.280
I figured it was a good example to get
comfortable with and it's pretty powerful.

21
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.420
So let's take a look at our ReadMe
while everything is downloading.

22
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.210
So we actually already did the safe form,

23
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.050
it looks like my instructions
were a little awful.

24
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.780
I'll make sure this gets updated
as soon as we're done here.

25
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.364
All right, cuz we already have all that.

26
00:01:46.835 --> 00:01:49.170
&gt;&gt; Male: That,
I think we need to keep still.

27
00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.890
&gt;&gt; Zac: We do need to keep some,
we do need that,

28
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.220
because we have new stuff there.

29
00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.960
Okay, so that is correct,
we do need to have that.

30
00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.310
My npm is installed, I'll run npm
start just to get it up and running.

31
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.990
And so let's come back into authentication
and see what we have waiting for us.

32
00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:14.030
So under my source authentication,
notice that

33
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.010
the first thing at top of
the screen is going to be save, so

34
00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.580
if we look in our file structure we
now have this file called, Save.js and

35
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.690
notice that everything now is
running as default classes.

36
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.482
So we could just pull that in.

37
00:02:32.198 --> 00:02:34.540
&gt;&gt; Zac: All this is already set up.

38
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.230
Now, when we log in,
we wanna do a few more things.

39
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.960
We also wanna take our new post form, and
if we come into our configuration file,

40
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.630
again, it's gonna keep getting
bigger the further we go.

41
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.730
We now have A loginForm, a logoutForm, but

42
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.530
we also have a newPostForm that just
has a class of addPostForm, and

43
00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.920
that's actually gonna be what houses
our TinyMCE editor and everything.

44
00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.770
So by default it's hidden, so

45
00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.370
we wanna remove that hidden
class once they're logged in.

46
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.250
The other thing we have and this is one of
the reasons I want to show you TinyMCE.

47
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.990
Is because it has a bunch
of configurations.

48
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.520
So you could set styling, so if you want
the background and padding to be a certain

49
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.670
way, what plugins are set up, so
you can control what buttons are there?

50
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.150
Whether you have a menu bar.

51
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.560
I'm sorry, and this is the buttons.

52
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.660
So paragraph, header, element bold link.

53
00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.730
And you can put blocks between them.

54
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.550
So this is a nice feature that you
could customize it all in this way.

55
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.780
And I stored it here cuz again we don't
want this being buried somewhere deep in

56
00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.400
our app and then possibly duplicated and
needing to revise these settings.

57
00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.160
So just throwing them in a config
is a good place for that.

58
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.300
And we can change this to
config.tinymceSettings.

59
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.920
So once we're logged in, not only will we
take care of the login logout form, but

60
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.610
we'll also take care of
displaying our post form and

61
00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.920
our TinyMCE editor initializing that.

62
00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.020
When you log out, you wanna go ahead and
get rid or hide the new post form,

63
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.410
but we don't need to do anything with
TinyMCE cuz it's already set up.

64
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:14.770
And even if they tried
to go into the dom and

65
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.720
change the class and then make
that form available and hit save,

66
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.010
because there's no cookie authentication
there, it won't work anyways.

67
00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.260
So our app is not entirely
insecure just because

68
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.030
we have stuff hidden as opposed
to remove from the page.

69
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.190
But ultimately,
when you're building in this kind of way,

70
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.630
you probably do want to be removing doms
and not just hiding and showing things.

71
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.880
We're kind of making it easy
on ourself at this point.

72
00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.890
So all of that is good.

73
00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.165
The only other thing we
have in here is there is,

74
00:04:47.025 --> 00:04:48.479
&gt;&gt; Zac: Where are we calling this?

75
00:04:54.399 --> 00:04:56.452
&gt;&gt; Zac: When you log.

76
00:05:01.434 --> 00:05:04.482
&gt;&gt; Zac: Okay,
when you logout of the site, we want to,

77
00:05:04.482 --> 00:05:07.319
although this should probably be on login.

78
00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:13.210
&gt;&gt; Zac: Okay, so what we're saying here.

79
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.090
We'll keep going.

80
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:16.040
If we have an error,
we'll come back to it.

81
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.060
But we're setting up our Save button.

82
00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.720
So our Save button.

83
00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.060
When it's clicked,
it should run save.post.

84
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.670
And that will take all of
our form data and save it.

85
00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:29.030
And that Save button is.

86
00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.850
I don't know if this is gonna work out,
let's see.

87
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.160
The save button, okay?

88
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.370
So when we click save,
it should gather up all this content and

89
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.920
load it, I'm sorry and save it.

90
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:44.274
So now I think we have to go
into our save.js file and

91
00:05:44.274 --> 00:05:46.536
look at what's happening there.

92
00:05:55.714 --> 00:06:00.408
&gt;&gt; Zac: So we'll open up our save.js.

93
00:06:00.408 --> 00:06:03.420
Start at the top,

94
00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:09.000
we'll need to get axios because we want
to make sure that we could run a call,

95
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.540
and we need to get our cookies because
our token is stored in the cookie.

96
00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.040
So we need to pull it out of
the cookie in order to save anything.

97
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:18.080
So we come down.

98
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.270
We make our post up.

99
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.120
And the way we're getting this,

100
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:26.220
we're gonna make our post by
grabbing this value and this value.

101
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.740
This is the exact same thing we did
last time around when saving the post.

102
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.259
So not too different, the TinyMCE editor.

103
00:06:39.077 --> 00:06:41.831
&gt;&gt; Zac: And now we'll come down here,
we actually save the post, so

104
00:06:41.831 --> 00:06:43.550
we'll change that to post.

105
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.860
The URL is going to be
just going to posts and

106
00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.610
the data is going to be this post
object that we just set up right here.

107
00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.430
So this is what we're passing.

108
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:57.830
And the nice thing about passing this in,
it will just save it.

109
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.880
And now we need to set up our headers.

110
00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.050
Remember when we requested the token for

111
00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:06.770
authentication, we had to
format our headers differently.

112
00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.880
We had to say, hey this is URL or
this is form encoded data.

113
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.740
When we're passing in JSON, of course
we want to tell it, hey, we're about to

114
00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:21.240
give you JSON, because if we give it some
unexpected file type, it won't work.

115
00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.510
And then this is specific
to the JW tokens.

116
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:30.330
It's going to take authorization
header with bearer and then the token.

117
00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:34.220
So remember this is the token
that we got from our cookie.

118
00:07:35.835 --> 00:07:38.622
COOKIE_ID needs to be changed or
that won't work.

119
00:07:38.622 --> 00:07:44.660
So right here we're saying,
get the name of our cookie,

120
00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:49.830
grab the value of the token, and
then pass that token in here.

121
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:52.870
So folks, this is the heart

122
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:57.360
of JWT authentication when
you're pushing in WordPress.

123
00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.660
So you need to have the content
type set to application/json, and

124
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:06.030
you need to have authorization,
bearer, a space, and then the token.

125
00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:08.580
So very specific syntax.

126
00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:13.090
And if you ever need to save data
outside of WordPress on your own,

127
00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:15.630
just copy the same format and
it should work for you.

128
00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:20.450
And then we're basically going to
load a message that says, save,

129
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:26.320
clear the form, and then reload,
refresh the posts on the page.

130
00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.860
So let's check our ReadMe and
make sure that that's all we got.

131
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:31.320
Yeah, looks good.

132
00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.330
Come back to our site.

133
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.364
Let's test it.

134
00:08:38.445 --> 00:08:42.510
&gt;&gt; Zac: Fingers crossed,
and we have an error.

135
00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:46.040
I mean, JavaScript shouldn't always
work on the first try, right?

136
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.050
Let's see what we've got here.

137
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.800
Server responded with a bad request.

138
00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:57.723
So that means that
&gt;&gt; Zac: Something

139
00:08:57.723 --> 00:09:01.739
about that request was not right,
let's plug it in.

140
00:09:13.194 --> 00:09:15.243
&gt;&gt; Zac: Well, wpj is on.

141
00:09:17.588 --> 00:09:19.510
&gt;&gt; Zac: Okay, if we go there,
that's right.

142
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:25.260
So the 400 error is telling us
that something we sent over

143
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:28.186
is not completely correct and
that's what's giving us the error.

144
00:09:28.186 --> 00:09:32.390
And we could see potentially
something is happening on line 75,

145
00:09:32.390 --> 00:09:37.320
which is just throwing us,
is that in save, yeah.

146
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.120
&gt;&gt; Male: This is the status on the post.

147
00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.871
I don't know if that's important or not.

148
00:09:45.128 --> 00:09:48.387
&gt;&gt; Zac: That might be totally important,
let's see.

149
00:10:02.526 --> 00:10:03.674
&gt;&gt; Zac: There we go, that was it.

150
00:10:03.674 --> 00:10:06.080
So brilliant on that.

151
00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.349
What that was saying is not
that it couldn't reach it,

152
00:10:09.349 --> 00:10:11.136
or not that it didn't exist.

153
00:10:11.136 --> 00:10:17.886
If you don't know http response codes,
they are definitely worth looking up,

154
00:10:17.886 --> 00:10:23.326
because that will give you a lot
of insight into exactly what is,

155
00:10:23.326 --> 00:10:27.173
this is the jam right here,
I love this site.

156
00:10:30.975 --> 00:10:35.639
&gt;&gt; Zac: All right, so if something is
created, it will give us a 201 back,

157
00:10:35.639 --> 00:10:41.980
if it's okay, it's 200, a bad request,
403 is forbidden, 401 is unauthorized.

158
00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:44.920
So if we had had something that
wasn't authorized for us or

159
00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:49.770
if it wasn't found, if we got a 404 that
would mean the URL was probably wrong.

160
00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:51.174
If we've got unauthorized,

161
00:10:51.174 --> 00:10:54.048
that means something with our
cookie might have been wrong.

162
00:10:54.048 --> 00:10:57.170
If we got a 400, that's telling us,
hey, you made a bad request.

163
00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.290
Which as you pointed out,
was exactly correct.

164
00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:03.010
Our request was formatted incorrectly and

165
00:11:03.010 --> 00:11:06.830
WordPress is like, I don't know
what the heck all caps status is.

166
00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:07.830
That's not published.

167
00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:08.959
That's not.

168
00:11:08.959 --> 00:11:09.459
That's not.

169
00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:15.610
Edit pending,
would be some possible options.

170
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:20.590
And I think if you leave this off
completely, it defaults to draft, so

171
00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:21.410
it won't publish it.

172
00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:24.280
So that's why we're hard coding and
saying publish it,

173
00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:28.180
otherwise in WordPress it has a draft
mode and you wouldn't see it on the site.

174
00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:31.540
So we have saving done on our site and

175
00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:33.920
let's just take a look around
again at what we have.

176
00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:34.790
We click Logout.

177
00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:40.060
And the user stuff appears,
that stuff is behind the scenes.

178
00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:43.921
And again I just want to show you that
if we were to come in to our elements.

179
00:11:46.713 --> 00:11:49.588
&gt;&gt; Zac: And notice that this
form is still on the page.

180
00:11:49.588 --> 00:11:54.560
[SOUND] Too big.

181
00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:59.480
And if we remove hidden,
that's gonna pop it up again.

182
00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:04.720
So what we do wanna check is
that this won't work, I hope.

183
00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.640
Let's get our console ready.

184
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:11.620
And so we click save, again,
we're not logged in, right?

185
00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:16.950
So we shouldn't have a cookie available
to us, there's no cookie here.

186
00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:22.486
And so when we click save,
notice that now we're getting a 403 error,

187
00:12:22.486 --> 00:12:26.168
which if we look back at
that site we were just at.

188
00:12:32.464 --> 00:12:34.300
&gt;&gt; Zac: Notice that now it's forbidden.

189
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.840
So before it was telling us,
hey, you did something wrong.

190
00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.300
You made a bad request.

191
00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:41.050
Now it's telling us you are forbidden
from accessing this because

192
00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:45.060
you don't have the correct credentials,
which is that token that we needed.
