00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.990
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: So, now what you need to
do on your own is work on doing the same

2
00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.770
thing, but you're gonna change the hook so
that it loads in the admin area.

3
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:14.752
So, deactivate 2.1 and then activate 2.2.

4
00:00:16.288 --> 00:00:18.960
&gt;&gt; Zac Gordon: Do your code, and
then come back to this page.

5
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.989
And when you open the console
in the admin area,

6
00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:23.443
you should actually see that
code running there, okay?

7
00:00:23.443 --> 00:00:28.679
And then, the third time you do it, you'll
see a special link show up in the admin

8
00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:33.687
area, and your custom code will only
show when you click on that custom link.

9
00:00:33.687 --> 00:00:35.830
Because that's our plugin page, okay?

10
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:41.450
So, let's see where we are after
five minutes, assess, and come back.

11
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.580
Again, it's only a little
bit of copying and pasting.

12
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.410
It shouldn't be too tricky what
we have going on here, okay?
