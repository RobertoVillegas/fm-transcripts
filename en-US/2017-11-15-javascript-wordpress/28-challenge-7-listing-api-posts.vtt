00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.562
&gt;&gt; Zac: Let's start off
working through this together.

2
00:00:02.562 --> 00:00:06.137
And then I'll give you a little bit
of time on your own to practice and

3
00:00:06.137 --> 00:00:08.725
see how far along you can get with things,
okay?

4
00:00:08.725 --> 00:00:13.693
So just showing you
the files real quick here.

5
00:00:19.095 --> 00:00:22.640
&gt;&gt; Zac: It, like all the things we're
doing, is going to go in stages.

6
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.331
So the first section
is going to start off,

7
00:00:26.331 --> 00:00:30.643
you're just going to show a list of posts,
okay?

8
00:00:34.226 --> 00:00:39.228
&gt;&gt; Zac: And then we're, no, that's 2,.1.

9
00:00:41.762 --> 00:00:43.260
&gt;&gt; Zac: Then you're gonna pass arguments.

10
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.040
So ultimately, we only want three posts on
the page, just because it's gonna make it

11
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.410
a little bit faster and
make the page smaller, okay?

12
00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.598
So you'll put some arguments in, and then
you'll write the code to save everything.

13
00:00:57.262 --> 00:01:01.510
&gt;&gt; Zac: And then you'll write the code
to edit, and then finally delete.

14
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.370
Okay, so I'll start doing
some of this with you, and

15
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.380
then I'll turn it over to
you to do on your own.

16
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.590
And this is just reminding me
one more thing I wanted to

17
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.610
mention before you get in.

18
00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.480
This form here is coming from PHP.

19
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.286
This is one of the things that it would
have taken us, cuz you'll see, we'll use

20
00:01:23.286 --> 00:01:27.483
TinyMCE when we use the decoupled example,
it would take us a lot of code.

21
00:01:27.483 --> 00:01:30.932
So to do all these different buttons and
all this, that would've just been crazy in

22
00:01:30.932 --> 00:01:33.980
a visual editor versus a text,
and hooking them with all this.

23
00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.140
So in our actual code,

24
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.090
we have a custom template,
that we’ve named custom.php.

25
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.260
And it’s not there, it’s in the save.

26
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.860
So what we’ve done is
this code right here, and

27
00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.810
you’ll see this as you start coding along.

28
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.870
It won’t be added till a little bit later,
but notice we're checking to see,

29
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:58.410
is the user logged in?

30
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.310
And do they have the ability
to edit other people's posts?

31
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.820
There are admins, editors, authors,
subscribers, contributors in WordPress.

32
00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.300
And this is checking to see that
they're an editor at least.

33
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.980
Then we're hard coding out
our New Post button, and

34
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.780
we're hard coding out our whole field.

35
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.900
And notice this line,

36
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.600
this is what I wanted to show you,
PHP Editor will put this out.

37
00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.700
So like I said,
when you're working in WordPress,

38
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.310
there are times where it's still
not a benefit to use the API.

39
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.590
And doing something like outputting the
entire WordPress editor with one line of

40
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.690
PHP versus trying to build and customize
that whole thing would just be insane.

41
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.830
So this is an example of where
a little bit PHP definitely helps.

42
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.370
And you'll see that unlike traditional
JavaScript apps, some of these is hard

43
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.564
coded, but then everything you list-posts
is just gonna be an empty div.

44
00:02:51.564 --> 00:02:55.260
And that'll be more like div with an ID
of an app where you fill everything in
