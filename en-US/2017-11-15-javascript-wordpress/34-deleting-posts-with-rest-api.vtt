1
00:00:00.306 --> 00:00:04.350
&gt;&gt; Zac: What I'm gonna do is, because
were outside of WordPress, these examples

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.730
are not themes and they're not plugins so
we don't have to copy them into WordPress.

3
00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.690
We could run them wherever we want.

4
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.520
And they're all leveraging
Webpak behind the scenes so

5
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.700
that we could just launch
up a server directly.

6
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:22.120
So I'm gonna copy this, I'm sorry,
I'm gonna drag this down into my editor.

7
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.662
Man, it's really hard to use
your computer when drag and

8
00:00:26.662 --> 00:00:29.246
drop doesn't work,
things we take for granted, okay.

9
00:00:39.547 --> 00:00:44.469
&gt;&gt; Zac: Okay, so
let me come down to the final example,

10
00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:47.927
deleting-posts-completed.

11
00:00:47.927 --> 00:00:52.692
I'm gonna open up my command line and

12
00:00:52.692 --> 00:00:57.158
I'm gonna cd into 6.6, okay?

13
00:00:59.062 --> 00:01:01.885
&gt;&gt; Zac: And once I'm in here,
because I don't,

14
00:01:01.885 --> 00:01:04.800
notice there's no known modules folder.

15
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.170
So the first thing you'll have
to do is run npm install.

16
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.680
That's not gonna work, hold on.

17
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.370
Okay, and
that's gonna pull down all your files.

18
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.750
So, you'll have to do this for
every one, so it may take a few seconds.

19
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.830
It may just be faster to copy and
paste, but you'll notice that

20
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.750
the requirements in the first
file are very small.

21
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:38.971
And then by the time we get to the end,
&gt;&gt; Zac: Not the destore package.

22
00:01:42.663 --> 00:01:46.776
&gt;&gt; Zac: Notice now not only do we have
access but we have a form url encoder or

23
00:01:46.776 --> 00:01:50.750
whatever that is and a JS cookie and
some more stuff in our thing.

24
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.820
So you can't copy all the files directly.

25
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.685
The other thing that I'll mention
especially for those that are watching and

26
00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:01.440
saw that I changed some of the repo.

27
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.636
Is that, when we get into saving posts,
because you can't take the entire

28
00:02:06.636 --> 00:02:11.749
WordPress editor and pass it via a JSON
string and have all that code work,

29
00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:15.974
I look forward to the days when
Internet pipes work that way.

30
00:02:15.974 --> 00:02:20.499
But we can't, so
when we get into our savings posts,

31
00:02:22.803 --> 00:02:26.589
&gt;&gt; Zac: Notice that in my distribution

32
00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:33.004
folder, I have tinymce here and
in my Index.html,

33
00:02:40.302 --> 00:02:41.930
&gt;&gt; Zac: Scroll with me now.

34
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.320
I'm just doing a hard link to it.

35
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.420
So maybe not the best approach ever.

36
00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.509
And you could definitely get
the slimmed down version,

37
00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:52.150
although this is the minified version.

38
00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.970
So again, not the best approach ever,
but this is how we're doing it.

39
00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.460
If you downloaded the code and
you come into one of the later examples,

40
00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.000
like let's say you come
into editing posts and

41
00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.200
you don't see inside your distribution
folder, the tinymce folder.

42
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.850
You have to copy and paste it from
one of the previous examples, okay?

43
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.750
So, if you come in the distribution for
editing posts,

44
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.970
or deleting posts, and
you don't see this tinymce folder.

45
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.920
You've gotta copy it but
I removed it just to save on speed, okay?

46
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.810
So, now everything should
be pulled in at this point.

47
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.237
Cool, let's run npm start,
I'll just show you again

48
00:03:36.237 --> 00:03:41.157
the package
&gt;&gt; Zac: Okay so

49
00:03:41.157 --> 00:03:44.800
our scripts in our JSON file,
our packet JSON.

50
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.390
We have start which is gonna
run webpack server on https.

51
00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:49.520
We need https.

52
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.044
Yes, you should never be doing
authentication with your site

53
00:03:54.044 --> 00:03:56.560
not on SSL and your app on SSL.

54
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.020
So our WordPress site has gotta be SSL.

55
00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.856
And [COUGH] whatever app
we're building is SSL.

56
00:04:01.856 --> 00:04:05.290
Otherwise the data that we're
sending is completely insecure and

57
00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.020
we do not wanna be sending user name and
passwords over the wild wild web, right?

58
00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.399
So that's something to point out.

59
00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:16.524
And then finally when your
ready to build for production,

60
00:04:16.524 --> 00:04:18.620
that option is there as well.

61
00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.159
So I could run NPM start.

62
00:04:25.122 --> 00:04:29.969
&gt;&gt; Zac: This will boot up my server and
it's going to tell

63
00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:34.354
me that this is going
to be running on https.

64
00:04:34.354 --> 00:04:35.459
Just give it a second here.

65
00:04:38.352 --> 00:04:39.410
&gt;&gt; Zac: Okay.

66
00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:40.557
So it's compiled and running now.

67
00:04:40.557 --> 00:04:44.070
I could come into my browser and
local host.

68
00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.902
I think it's at 3000.

69
00:04:47.902 --> 00:04:49.300
Check it out.

70
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.220
Looks familiar right?

71
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:55.990
This is not running on WordPress,
necessarily the server.

72
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.780
So this could go straight
up on any server.

73
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.430
It doesn't have to be connected
to the WordPress site.

74
00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:01.470
We click on something.

75
00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:02.440
We see the full post.

76
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.190
Notice that this is just an excerpt.

77
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:09.340
And then, there will be more
when you go into the page, so

78
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.270
containing that single-page view.

79
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.129
And then, we also have the ability
to log in to our site.

80
00:05:19.491 --> 00:05:27.533
&gt;&gt; Zac: And now we see,
I didn't copy over Teenymce, so it broke.

81
00:05:27.533 --> 00:05:28.347
Let me do that real quick.

82
00:05:31.316 --> 00:05:34.339
&gt;&gt; Zac: And I'm just gonna check,
like I said, that that,

83
00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:37.040
in my index file it's
all linked up properly.

84
00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.280
That link should still be there.

85
00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.760
Okay, yeah, so that's there.

86
00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.440
Let's see, is it copied over?

87
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:43.940
Almost done.

88
00:05:47.437 --> 00:05:49.877
&gt;&gt; Zac: I will say when I was
playing around with this,

89
00:05:49.877 --> 00:05:52.080
there are a number of different editors.

90
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.220
So this is one of the problems
when you move decoupled and

91
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.650
you wanna let people edit.

92
00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:58.330
There's a few major ones out there.

93
00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.170
Some of them work better
with some framework.

94
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:01.876
Some of them work better than others.

95
00:06:01.876 --> 00:06:04.686
But because WordPress is
already using teenymce,

96
00:06:04.686 --> 00:06:08.100
it's kind of tricky sometimes
to set up and work with.

97
00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.879
That was part of the reason
I did that here, but

98
00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:13.533
it has taken a really
long time to copy over.

99
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.316
&gt;&gt; Zac: Okay, I come up and demo this
again, I'm gonna let you get started.

100
00:06:21.316 --> 00:06:26.057
But basically, what you should see is
the exact same thing we had before

101
00:06:26.057 --> 00:06:30.180
where you'll see the ability
to edit posts and delete them.

102
00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:30.680
Here we go, okay.

103
00:06:33.487 --> 00:06:34.936
&gt;&gt; Zac: Let's log out and start this over.

104
00:06:38.154 --> 00:06:41.980
&gt;&gt; Zac: Okay, so we've got our posts,
we can go ahead and log in.

105
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:49.762
&gt;&gt; Zac: And now we could see,
we have this action, New Posty.

106
00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:55.010
&gt;&gt; Zac: Heyo more, more, more.

107
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.330
Save it, and
we get the same message as before.

108
00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:59.490
The form clears.

109
00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:00.910
This time we don't have a toggle one.

110
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:02.210
It was just one more thing to add.

111
00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.790
And I figured if you know the JavaScript
to toggle something, that's not too bad.

112
00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:09.417
But now we could click on edit,
it'll pop it up into the edit field,

113
00:07:09.417 --> 00:07:11.722
we could edit it, we could also delete it.

114
00:07:11.722 --> 00:07:16.580
And unlike our last app,
not only can we edit and add stuff, but

115
00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:22.370
we can actually click into a specific
page as well and view that extra data.

116
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.970
So that wasn't in our standalone one,
it looks like something

117
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:29.810
went wrong here with that content
being cleared, it should be, okay.

118
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:34.236
So this is what we're after, and the
benefits of being able to do this, is that

119
00:07:34.236 --> 00:07:38.820
you can now basically do whatever you
need and work through the authentication.

120
00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.290
You could have them editing posts,

121
00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:44.840
deleting it, and we're not tied to
WordPress at all, except via the API.
