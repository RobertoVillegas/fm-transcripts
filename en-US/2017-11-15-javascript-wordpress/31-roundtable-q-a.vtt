1
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.640
&gt;&gt; Zac: Let's talk about
what we've done here.

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.060
So everybody has had an example to, or
had a chance to at least work through.

3
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.660
Thumbs up if you got through
saving something successfully.

4
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.820
All right, thumbs stay up if that felt
good at some emotional level to have it,

5
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.310
yeah, okay.

6
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:20.960
I'd like to take a moment then, let's
just go around and hear from everyone.

7
00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.510
If you have a question, or
insight something that you noticed,

8
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.150
anything like that, and
we'll start over at the far end here.

9
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.534
Speak into the microphone, please.

10
00:00:32.961 --> 00:00:36.367
&gt;&gt; Female: Just to ask, somebody who
has no PHP background at all, and

11
00:00:36.367 --> 00:00:37.900
just JavaScript.

12
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.760
I'm kind of really enjoying this even
though we haven't really touched

13
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.680
any of the PHP.

14
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.040
So I'm a little nervous about
diving into that later on,

15
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.558
but otherwise overall enjoying it.

16
00:00:47.558 --> 00:00:48.320
&gt;&gt; Zac: Nice.

17
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.230
That is actually really great feedback and
if you stay in the WordPress ecosystem,

18
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.180
that's what PHP learning is like.

19
00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.290
It's just little bits,
it's pretty manageable.

20
00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.040
So hopefully that will continue on.

21
00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.600
Very cool.

22
00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.490
&gt;&gt; Male: I think some prerequisites
would have been cool too,

23
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:09.050
just having a little bit to take
a look at before we come in here.

24
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.140
I took a look at some of the stuff and
have worked with my own WordPress

25
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.120
website a little bit, but
I've learned a lot here.

26
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.020
So the single page application
stuff is really cool.

27
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.980
And like you said,
once you get that stuff working and

28
00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.400
you can update that, it's really.

29
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.920
&gt;&gt; Zac: Nice, yeah.

30
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.100
I think that you're right.

31
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.850
That, again, my assumption was that most
folks watching or here at the workshop,

32
00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.080
would have built a theme or
have some of that.

33
00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.830
So double applause to tackling this weird
alien environment without that background.

34
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:46.726
Let's jump to the back row.

35
00:01:46.726 --> 00:01:50.120
&gt;&gt; Male: Just it's really nice.

36
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.500
Kind of an expedited path that you can
follow now to develop your own stuff

37
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.350
if you like.

38
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.810
Gets the really basics taken care of.

39
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.450
&gt;&gt; Zac: Cool, so you're okay with the,
here's a bunch of code,

40
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.998
just change these few things, and then-
&gt;&gt; Male: [CROSSTALK] And manipulate it.

41
00:02:04.998 --> 00:02:05.863
&gt;&gt; Zac: Comes into place?

42
00:02:05.863 --> 00:02:07.630
&gt;&gt; Male: After that,
based on what you're looking for, yeah.

43
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:08.470
&gt;&gt; Zac: Cool.
How long do you

44
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.530
think we would've been here if we'd
coded everything today from scratch?

45
00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.503
&gt;&gt; Male: We probably would've
gotten through one of the things.

46
00:02:13.503 --> 00:02:14.126
&gt;&gt; Zac: [LAUGH] Yeah,
we'd still be in [CROSSTALK] QS.

47
00:02:14.126 --> 00:02:17.659
[CROSSTALK] that big wouldn't
probably be what happened.

48
00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:18.570
How about you?

49
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.450
&gt;&gt; Female: I really liked how it's, like
WordPress, but it's also JavaScript, so

50
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.470
it patches together the small bits of
knowledge that aren't really workable

51
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:31.130
that I have into like a big picture.

52
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.480
I can actually do stuff with these
half-finished coding tutorials.

53
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.400
&gt;&gt; Zac: Totally, and I think that you hit
the nail on where we are with JavaScript.

54
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.380
Like I said, you could build
full apps based on the API.

55
00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.190
But what most people are doing and
the biggest wins are just like

56
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.950
a little bit here, and
it makes it that much slicker, right?

57
00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.590
And so awesome, good feedback.

58
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.560
&gt;&gt; Male: Yeah,
I definitely appreciate the moldability to

59
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.820
all the work that we did
today as someone who hasn't.

60
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:09.540
I kinda stopped at getting my
situation kind of figured out,

61
00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.770
getting things hooked up
on the development side.

62
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.550
One thing I,

63
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:22.580
just I might appreciate as someone who is
kind of freak for having all of my notes.

64
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:28.329
Kind of look less on my computer if it
would be possible to take the slides and

65
00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.455
make that into a raw readme file or
something like that

66
00:03:32.455 --> 00:03:33.620
&gt;&gt; Zac: So good, okay.

67
00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.260
&gt;&gt; Male: It's a little more
like digestible that's just

68
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.950
as I'm kind of tooling
around a little bit now.

69
00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:40.850
&gt;&gt; Zac: No, that is brilliant.

70
00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.221
I'll take all the slides and put them
in a markdown format or something,

71
00:03:44.221 --> 00:03:46.552
then you could just read [SOUND],
nice, awesome.

72
00:03:46.552 --> 00:03:48.250
Cool, good feedback.

73
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.170
How about for you?

74
00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.280
&gt;&gt; Male: I thought that
the responsiveness,

75
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.750
actually, of the code
is surprisingly nifty.

76
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.600
I thought it was for some JavaScript code,
it takes a long time to load.

77
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.960
This was actually surprisingly fast.

78
00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.520
So the code is straightforward
to understand,

79
00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.370
as long as you've seen it before.

80
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.450
But that's the first thing that
came to mind, was like, yeah,

81
00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.770
this loads fairly fast.

82
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.740
&gt;&gt; Zac: Good, because sometimes
the API can be a little slow, so

83
00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.020
it's good that your initial
feel was responsive.

84
00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.820
Did most people feel it was pretty quick?

85
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.510
You weren't waiting too long?

86
00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.780
Good, that's what we're looking for,
awesome.

87
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:25.790
Best for last, eh?

88
00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.370
&gt;&gt; Male: As someone who really has thought
at different times in my life that

89
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.893
WordPress was kind of equivalent
to blogger.com or simple.

90
00:04:34.893 --> 00:04:35.860
&gt;&gt; Zac: Yes.
&gt;&gt; Male: This,

91
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.050
I'm amazed that kind of power.

92
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.270
And I think as time goes on, I go through
the notes, I'll discover more and

93
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.380
more that you can do with this.

94
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.270
And the second observation, for being a
one day course, I've been impressed by how

95
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.600
much interactive you've been with
the students in the chatroom and stuff.

96
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.820
And I've gotten a lot of feedback
just from you, personally,

97
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.030
which I definitely was not expecting.

98
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.250
&gt;&gt; Zac: Hoorah, well,
thanks for all coming.

99
00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.700
I've enjoyed that, too?

100
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.300
&gt;&gt; Male: And I guess I'd add that
I've done a lot of consulting for

101
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.270
start ups and just working here as well.

102
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.030
WordPress is how people
get ideas off the ground.

103
00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.100
It's really just the real fast,

104
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.900
simple framework that you
can pull a bunch of plugins.

105
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.570
And then mold your application
to do something that

106
00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.230
really hasn't been done before, or does
what you need it to do for your business.

107
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.298
So a lot of people built
the version 1 [LAUGH].

108
00:05:28.298 --> 00:05:30.370
&gt;&gt; Zac: Yeah
&gt;&gt; Male: On WordPress.

109
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.260
And in our case, we are continuing
to use it [LAUGH] because

110
00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.080
it's just such a big
project to get off of it.

111
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.430
Even though we have a successful app and

112
00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.890
we're making a lot of
changes to it incoming.

113
00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.319
But it's just the ease
of use to stand up and

114
00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:47.690
how many plugins that you can get into it.

115
00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.110
So if anyone's entrepreneurial,

116
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.250
just a great fantastic way to
get things off the ground.

117
00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.860
And another experience work for
big corporation and they were always just

118
00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:03.510
shocked that how much
their C-sharper you know,

119
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:08.420
C language based CMS' would cost
to do anything you know, right?

120
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.010
And it's like,

121
00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:13.420
yeah you wanna build a website,
that's gonna be a $100,000 or $200,000.

122
00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.120
And it's like, you know what,

123
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.030
I'd keep saying in WordPress, I can stand
this up in a week by myself [LAUGH].

124
00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:20.363
&gt;&gt; Zac: And I only charge you 50.

125
00:06:20.363 --> 00:06:22.470
&gt;&gt; Male: [LAUGH] Yeah,
only charge a $50 grand.

126
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:25.510
So those are just some
things to add to that.

127
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.121
&gt;&gt; Zac: Awesome, very good feedback.

128
00:06:27.121 --> 00:06:28.220
Yeah, I like that.

129
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:33.177
And I guarantee that like in the next
moon, at least half of you will have some

130
00:06:33.177 --> 00:06:37.030
over conversation where
WordPress could be a solution.

131
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.890
And the other person might not even know
it, and you don't have to bring it up

132
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.810
to him because then you're also
volunteering your help, right?

133
00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:47.230
But you'll end up and had be like, that
WordPress could do that pretty easy right.

134
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:51.470
&gt;&gt; Male: So do you feel like
focusing on JavaScript and

135
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:55.677
WordPress as future-proofing yourself,
at least for the next four months?

136
00:06:55.677 --> 00:06:59.298
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Male: I mean, is this up and

137
00:06:59.298 --> 00:07:01.050
coming or way over this behind the curve?

138
00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.570
&gt;&gt; Zac: I think it'll take
you four months of this to

139
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:09.000
get over the next hump of leaving here and
really getting more comfortable.

140
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000
But I can even see in the next,

141
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.540
I think five years is safe to say
that WordPress is not gonna go away.

142
00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.240
It's still gonna gain a few
percentages of the web.

143
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.670
JavaScript sure ain't going away.

144
00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:25.702
And after that time, more and more
developers will already have these skills,

145
00:07:25.702 --> 00:07:29.380
so like at this point you really do have a
cutting edge, and anyone watching at home,

146
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:30.370
you do too.

147
00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:32.700
So this is all valuable.
