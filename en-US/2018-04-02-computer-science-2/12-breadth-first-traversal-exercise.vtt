00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.101
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: So in this one,
I gave you a little helper tree up here,

2
00:00:04.101 --> 00:00:05.322
you can kinda see.

3
00:00:05.322 --> 00:00:10.857
And I also put it in alphabetical order so
you can see, it should come out A, B, C,

4
00:00:10.857 --> 00:00:16.650
D, E, F, etc,, right, so, [COUGH] that's
what your traversal should look like.

5
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.990
You can see down here it expects
it to be A, B, C, D, E, F, G.

6
00:00:26.891 --> 00:00:29.280
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: And
here's what the tree looks like.

7
00:00:33.704 --> 00:00:37.784
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Cool, and yeah,
I'm gonna give you let's say,

8
00:00:37.784 --> 00:00:41.100
another 15 minutes to do this as well.

9
00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.620
And then, we'll come back and
we'll do it together.

10
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.090
Just to tell you how many lines
of code I used to solve this.

11
00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:53.642
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: I think it's about 15-ish.

12
00:00:53.642 --> 00:00:54.142
No.

13
00:00:56.428 --> 00:00:57.410
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: A bit less than that.

14
00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.670
Let's go with closer to like nine,
ten lines of code or something like that.

15
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.440
More or less the same for
the recursive and the iterative.

16
00:01:08.618 --> 00:01:10.470
&gt;&gt; Brian Holt: Yeah, cool.

17
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.660
So I'm gonna give you 15 minutes.

18
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.980
And yeah, we'll come back and
talk about it.
